					<h2><a href="https://github.com/mouradap/mirPFBC">microRNAs and Primary Familial Brain Calcification</a></h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Python, HTML, Data Visualization, Pandas</p>
					<p>This project successfully identified microRNAs that target simultaneously more than two PFBC-causing genes. Using public database miRDB, Denis found that miR4728, miR6785, miR149 and miR6878 through their regulatory potential of PFBC-causing genes, are important candidates for the development of PFBC phenotypes. Their specific function in regulating such genes is still unknown. Experimental in vitro and in vivo analysis are necessary to confirm these associations and to understand their function on PFBC.</p>

					<p>This project led to the presentation "What do our brains tell us about dementia? Machine Learning applied to Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury Study". This study attempted to find transcriptome patterns of dementia in aged human brains. Random Forest models with 10 classifier genes chosen from Importance Analysis were able to correctly identify around 82% of dementia samples based solely on transcriptome profiles. This was the Denis' first Machine Learning project and granted the <a href=certificados/sinater2019_premio_denis.pdf>third best presentation award</a> at the X International Symposium on
Diagnostics and Therapeutics (SINATER, 2019).</p>

					<h3>Brain calcifications and PCDH12 variants</h3>
					<p class="subDetails">Neurology Genetics, v. 3, p. e166, 2017. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1212/NXG.0000000000000166> doi.org/10.1212/NXG.0000000000000166</a> </p>
					<p>Objective: To assess the potential connection between PCDH12 and brain calcifications in a patient carrying a homozygous nonsense variant in PCDH12 and in adult patients with brain calcifications.

Methods: We performed a CT scan in 1 child with a homozygous PCDH12 nonsense variant. We screened DNA samples from 53 patients with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) and 26 patients with brain calcification of unknown cause (BCUC).

Results: We identified brain calcifications in subcortical and perithalamic regions in the patient with a homozygous PCDH12 nonsense variant. The calcification pattern was different from what has been observed in PFBC and more similar to what is described in in utero infections. In patients with PFBC or BCUC, we found no protein-truncating variant and 3 rare (minor allele frequency <0.001) PCDH12 predicted damaging missense heterozygous variants in 3 unrelated patients, albeit with no segregation data available.

Conclusions: Brain calcifications should be added to the phenotypic spectrum associated with PCDH12 biallelic loss of function, in the context of severe cerebral developmental abnormalities. A putative role for PCDH12 variants remains to be determined in PFBC.</p>

					<h3>New Data from Pdfgbret/ret Mutant Mice Might Lead to a Paradoxical Association Between Brain Calcification, Pericytes Recruitment and BBB Integrity.</h3>
					<p class="subDetails">Journal of Molecular Neuroscience, v.1, p.1-3, 2017. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-017-0992-z>doi.org/10.1007/s12031-017-0992-z</a> </p>
					<p>Data of mice with PDGF-B-truncating mutation (Pdgfb ret/ret) from different research groups indicate that the malfunction of this protein leads to reduced pericyte recruitment, loss of Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) integrity and bilateral brain calcification. This makes these mice important models for Primary Brain Calcification and pericyte-BBB correlation studies. The global brain pericyte count is reduced in Pdgfb ret/ret mice, with higher BBB permeability. We have overlapped the data from other research groups into a figure to further analyze the findings. Calcifications form within midbrain, interbrain, basal forebrain, and pons. Interestingly, these calcification-prone regions have a comparably higher pericyte count and lower BBB leakage in relation to other non-calcifying regions of the Pdgfb ret/ret mouse (such as the cortex and striatum). A comparatively higher BBB integrity in regions prone to calcification seems paradoxical and indicates that other region-specific changes are the cause of the calcifications.</p>

					<h3>XPR1: a Gene Linked to Primary Familial Brain Calcification Might Help Explain a Spectrum of Neuropsychiatric Disorders</h3>
					<p class="subDetails">Journal of Molecular Neuroscience, v.57, p.519-521, 2015.<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-015-0631-5>doi.org/10.1007/s12031-015-0631-5</a> </p>
					<p>Primary familial brain calcifications (PFBC) compose a rare neurologic condition characterized by a bilateral pattern of hydroxyapatite deposits in basal ganglia, dentate nuclei, and thalamus. PFBC is identified through neuroimaging screenings such as computerized tomography. Patients with PFBC might present a wide variety of neurological symptoms such as mental and motor impairments, often misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and migraine. Four genes were confirmed as causative of PFBC: SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1. Curiously, other studies made occasional links between XPR1 variations or expression changes, in a few neuropsychiatric models. This letter is an assembly on XPR1 variants and expression change pattern data that were published in recent scientific reports, even before the current connection between that gene and brain calcification.</p>

					<p>Continuing his research on the genetics of Primary Familial Brain Calcification, Denis joined the doctorate program in the same institution, the Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biologia Aplicada à Saúde (PPGBAS) of the Laboratório de Imunopatologia Keizo Asami, also supervised by Prof. Dr. João Ricardo Mendes de Oliveira MD, Ph.D. In this new comprehensive project, stronger analytical programming skills were necessary. Denis dove deep into Data Science, improving and learning crucial data skills. Several projects were developed in order to train and gain experience in the field, which awarded Denis the best presentations of PPGBAS's yearly international scientific symposiums since 2018.</p>
